      "Monoblock frame machined from a single piece of Aluminum 6061-T6, eliminating mechanically fastened joints. This design reduces tolerance stack-up, increases structural stiffness, and decreases fastener loosening risk during launch vibrations.

      "Internal surfaces are black anodized to increase emissivity and boost heat exchange among internal components (EPS, OBC, COMMS, Payload). Deployer interface rails are hard-anodized and Teflon-impregnated to reduce friction, prevent cold welding, and ensure P-POD deployer compatibility.",

      overview="The Structural and Thermal Subsystem (STS) provides the main mechanical load path, thermal control interface, and environmental protection for Team Anant's nanosatellite. It acts as the primary structural connection between the spacecraft and the launch vehicle, ensuring all onboard subsystems operate within their specified mechanical and thermal limits during launch and orbital operations."
      overviewDetails="The STS is built to endure combined static, vibrational, and acoustic loads experienced during launch (greater than 10 Grms) and the thermal-vacuum environment of Low Earth Orbit (LEO). Following ECSS structural design guidelines, the subsystem employs a monoblock structural architecture to reduce part count, eliminate joint-related failures, and improve overall stiffness. This keeps the spacecraft's fundamental natural frequency well separated from launch vehicle excitation frequencies, minimizing dynamic coupling and resonance during ascent."
