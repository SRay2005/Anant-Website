      overview="The Telemetry, Tracking and Command Subsystem serves as the communication backbone of the satellite mission. It is responsible for receiving real-time health and status data (telemetry) from the satellite and transmitting commands from the ground. The subsystem uses a UHF transceiver for beaconing and an S-band transceiver for downlinking mission data."
      overviewDetails="The ground station enables mission control to monitor and manage operations throughout the mission lifecycle. Using deployable antennas and AX.25 protocol for data framing, the TTC provides reliable communication links during ground station passes. The system supports both beacon transmission and commanded data downloads."
